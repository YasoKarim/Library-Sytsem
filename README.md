#Attention:  
 -contribution on github doesn't reflect how developers distributed tasks among themselves  
 -the azure server will be closed due to cost related issues we will not provide a replacement and the code will not be runnable anymore  
 -the server package inside the src file is an independent program and it has to be run first  
   
-A recording of the running project is uploaded as "Recording #1.mp4" but it is not the final version and it still has some errors  
-all the errors were fixed and all functionalities were added but not updated in the video   
  
#We made it and we get a very big bonus for it, we are actually the only ones who got an A+ in advanced programming for that year in our college :D!
